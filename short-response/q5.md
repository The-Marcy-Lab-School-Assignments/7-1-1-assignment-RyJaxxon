# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

Both `/products/apple` and `/products/5` will satisfy the `/products/:id` path because they both fulfill the requirement of having only one additional segment past `/products/`, though since it doesn't have a way to parse what that segment is it will accept either.
