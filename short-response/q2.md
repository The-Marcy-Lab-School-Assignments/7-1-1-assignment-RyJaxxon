# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer

- Faster Navigating: SPAs only load a single HTML page then work by dynamically changing the components the user sees on the screen, without the need to load other HTML pages navigation becomes seamless.
- Reduced Load: SPAs mainly deal with routing and rendering on via the client side, so our server can relax and take things a little easier.
- Maintenance: SPAs often use frameworks like react which make things easier to maintain
